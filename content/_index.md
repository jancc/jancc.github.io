Hi! Iâ€™m Jan (he/him). I'm a programmer by trade. I've majored in computer
science and am currently working as a developer of e-commerce platforms, with a
focus on _Magento 2_. However, I am interested in many different things. Be it writing tools
that help me in my day-to-day grind or hobbyist game projects.
You can find some of the stuff that I made on this website!
