It is basically asteroids. Still, its one of the first ever playable
games I made that has a real gameplay loop.

FYI: There are to versions of the game. `oea_bin.exe` gives you the version
with audiere.dll powered music. `oea_web.exe` is slightly stripped and without
m√∫sic. The second one works better in Wine.
