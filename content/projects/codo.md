This game was mostly made in 2020 when I had a lot of time on my hands. Then I
suddenly stopped having lots of time on my hands and the project got put on
hold. It is a top down shooter about saving a rock star who was abducted by
aliens. The main character is a wrestler with a gun. You can punch and shoot
and have to fight your way through a horde of aliens. The levels are kept
rather open, the basic idea being that you have to search and collect some
diamonds in each level to progress.

I developed this project in C using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).
Development-wise a lot more effort went into the game's engine and the whole
backend details than the game itself. But I'd learned a lot about compiling
native stuff for the web via _Emscripten_ and even got to contribute a tiny
thing to the Emscripten project in the process, which was nice. Additional
details include a custom, compressed format for the game's levels and a system
to smoothly and automatically switch from keyboard+mouse to gamepad controls.

You can play the game either directly in the browser or download a compiled
version for Windows or Linux. I don't plan on open sourcing this, because its
mostly uncommented C11 code. If you ask nicely I might reconsider, but don't
say I didn't warn you ;P
