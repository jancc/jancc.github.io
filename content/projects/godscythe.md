You are in the process of being moved between prisons when the train derails.
With nothing to lose you run. But the situation you find
yourself in may be worse than confinement...

## Installation Notices

You need a full copy of Quake 1. If you don't own Quake yet you can get it
on [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_the_offering) for a few bucks.

The mod features custom maps, music and QuakeC.

During development the mod was tested with
[QuakeSpasm](http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net). Using this source
port is guaranteed to work, but most others should function as well.
Realtime lighting (as provided by i.e. DarkPlaces) may not understand all lights
used in the maps. Stick to the pre-baked lightmaps instead.
