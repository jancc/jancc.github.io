This little game was made for [Fuck This Jam
2014](https://itch.io/jam/fuck-this-jam).

<blockquote cite="https://itch.io/jam/fuck-this-jam">
    Fuck This Jam 2014 (May 31st - June 6th, 2014) is a gamejam that challenges
    you to make a game in a genre you hate. As developers, we're all being told
    to make games we love playing, or games we love making. Genres we know the
    in and outs of, genres that we research before starting on a game. We ask
    you to do one simple thing: spend one week making a game in a genre you
    dislike, a genre you don't care about and a genre you don't know about.

At the time the YouTube channel _retsupurae_ regularly featured shoddy games
made in Unity that claimed to be "works of art". With _A Dark Dawn_ I played
on that formula and made something which you'd now call a walking simulator.
With, frankly, way to much text. Albeit deliberately ;)

[The original itch.io page is still up.](https://xrcore.itch.io/add). But good
luck getting this thing to run with the defunct Unity web player. There is also
a binary for Linux (and only for Linux), which - I think - was also part of the
joke. [The source code is also still up on Github](https://github.com/jancc/artisticque),
if you want to peek into it.
