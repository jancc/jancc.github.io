A zombie shooter with a twist. Shooting requires you to type a text. Each
character of the text equals one fired bullet. But your two-hand typing
technique won’t help you a bit! You’ll also have to use your mouse to aim. Can
you type quickly enough with only one free hand?? Find it out in this unique
zombie shooter.

Originally made in 2013. Semi-Regularly updated to newer Unity versions.
