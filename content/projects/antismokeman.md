This game was made as a school project for an anti-smoking campaign. While
others made infographics and videos, we'd thought the best way to learn was to
blow up cutesy cigarettes. I'll let you be the judge as to how effective that
actually is. Though here is a fun fact: The game actually WAS supposed to be
less violent. You were simply supposed to jump on enemy heads to defeat them.
However back then I could never get this to work 100% percent of the time
because I had yet to figure out the concept of timesteps and collision
detection in games :)
