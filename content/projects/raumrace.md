This is the earliest project for which I still have the binary. There were some
before this, but they're lost for good. The "game" consists of you having to
click on images of scary-looking aliens until all of them disappear. If they
hit your spaceship, you loose a life. The whole thing was meant as a demo for
a much more ambitious space-game project that never materialized.

Fun fact: I originally made this in 2006 and re-discovered this in 2012. At the
time it felt like a relic for forever ago. Now 2012 is much longer ago that
2006 was at the time. lol
