Back in 2020 I had _a lot_ of free time on my hands. I had been working hard on
my master's thesis during that year's summer as well, which did also take a
huge chunk of time. But apart from that, there weren't really many other
opportunities outside of my own four walls to waste time on. So I'd also work
on a small game project on the side. It was nothing special really. Just a 2D
top down shooter. Add to that the fact that I enjoyed the details of engine
programming a lot more than the actual game design portion, and you get a game
that is fun, but nothing special. Nevertheless, the fact that there wasn't much
else going on I grew quite fond of the game. Hell, I even imagined selling it
for a teensy tiny price at some point. Looking back that was a little
preposterous, but there you go :)

So once things got a little more normal the game sat, unfinished as it was,
waiting to be completed released one day. I think that day now came, because
over the last year I'd fixed up the remaining issues and tied the whole thing
together such that it has a coherent start and finish. With a cool bossfight
and outro and everything.

So I guess the moral of the story is that the project has now arrived in
reality. Where it is just one of thousands of games like it, but this one is
mine :) Oh. And also it is online at all, which is also an improvement to
before where it was just a bunch of code, images and music on my harddrives.

You can find the game on its dedicated project page:
